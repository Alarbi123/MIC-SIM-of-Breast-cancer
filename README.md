MICRO-SIMULATION MODELLING OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER: A COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT SCREENING PROGRAMMES
Estimate potential population-level optimal screening age range and the appropriate screening interval based on comparison of different screening strategies.
Apply the continuous growth models (CGMs) to understand the natural history of breast cancer from onset to detection using the proposed optimal screening strategy. 
Incorporate BMI risk factor on the growth sub-model of the CGMs to compare different screening models, and predict the effect of BMI categories on screening outcomes to contribute to personalized
